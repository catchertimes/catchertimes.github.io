									<h3 class="major">The Phoniness of Adults.</h3>
									<p>“The Catcher in the Rye”, a novel written by J.D Sallinger showcases the life of a teenager and his problems growing up in life. Holden Caulfield is a 16-year-old boy who goes to an all-boys school called “Pencey Prep”. Holden throughout the story talks to many different people including adults who Holden thinks are “phonies”. When Holden talks about a “phony”, he thinks of a hypocrite, a liar, or simply a fake person, someone who doesn’t appear like who you think they are. Holden has a deep hate for phonies and is worried when he grows up he will become a phony as well. Holden at the same time feels that some people younger than adults can be phony as well and not realize it. However, Holden fails to realize that he is in fact a phony himself. Holden lies and doesn’t represent himself as what he truly is in the story which is also a characteristic that he had given to a phony. Holden and his thoughts about Phonies lead him to a deep depression and loneliness. He thinks the world will never be perfect due to all of the phonies. 
									</p>

									<p>Holden is correct in his theory of phoniness in some ways. In the novel, Holden talks about his old school which was called Elkton Hills. Holden talks about his experience with the headmaster in the school named Mr.Haas. Mr.Haas was a phony according to Holden as he was only charming to some people. Mr.Haas would welcome all of the parents by shaking hands with them and have healthy conversations with them. However, a problem Holden realized was whenever the headmaster saw some parents that he considered “funny looking” he would give them a fake smile and that’s it. Holden mentioned that this was a reason why he left the school, because of all the phoniness that happened at that place with the headmaster.</p>

									<p>However, Holden can be considered a hypocrite as he can be seen being a phony himself even though he explains his hate for them. One reason why holden is a phony is when talking to new people, Holden uses fake stories and fake names instead of his real identity. This is known when talking on the train with Mrs.Morrow and Holden introduces himself as Rudolf Schmidt, the school Janitor. Holden also said his name was Jim Steele to Sunny the prostitute. However, a name change is not the only reason why Holden is a phony. Holden lies about his age to be able to get goods such as Alcohol and he makes up a lie for the reason why he’s leaving Pencep Prep. Overall Holden is a phony. He is a hypocrite, a liar and in general a fake person due to his interactions throughout the story.
									</p>

									<p>Overall, there is a huge theme of phoniness in the story. A huge part of it comes from Holden calling other phonies and talking about his hate for phonies, but at the same time, a lot of the theme comes from Holden being a phony himself and lying. A phony is a liar, a hypocrite and will do anything to be a fake person. Holden could be lying about many more huge topics in the novel. For all we know, Holden could have good grades, or be secretly an amazing athlete, or even lie about his brother’s death. Holden is not very emotional when it comes to his brother’s death and a reason for this is because holden could be a phony and lying about his brother’s death for attention and people caring. “The Catcher in the Rye” successfully showcases Holden’s story and his story on his hate for phonies and him being a phony himself.
